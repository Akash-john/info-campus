            1. dependent tag - Those tags, that open and close separate
                    example:
                            <html> </html>
                            <body> </body>
                            <xyz> </xyz>

            2. independent tag / self-close tags:
                    example:
                            <br> it is wrong, <br/> 100% valid
                            <hr>  ""   . , <hr/>


        
        => The Behavior of html tags:

                        1.Block level tag:
                                       => it print the statement in newline.
                        2.Inline tag
                                       => it print the statement in same line -(side by side)



        Note - Using CSS3
        1. inline tags => convert to block level tag.
        2. block level tag => convert to => inline tag.


    That is called responsive design
