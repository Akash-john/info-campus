                Class is in Javascript : The Class is collections of member variable
                and member function
            </p>
            <p>
                Member Variable: The Variables get defined under consturctor using this 
                operator, that variable can be use inside the class as well as
                outside of the class. to access memeber variable inside the class need to use "this"
                keyword. and to access outside we need to use object of the class
            </p>

            <p>
                Member Function : All the user defined function  of a class is called 
                member function.
            </p>

            <p> Object of Class : The object is instance (or) copy of a class</p>
            
            <p>
                What is "this" keyword ?
                    --It is object of a class but it will work inside the class.
            </p>

            <p>
                Constructor : life Cycle function of Javascript. it get call
                automatically whenever class object get created.
            </p>

            <p>
                extends : it use to inherit feature from 1 class to other(parent - child).
            </p>

        <script>
        obj1.printdata("<h1>Welcome To Class Object</h1>");
